#  KOTOBADAN Project / 言葉暖 Project

### This project is meant to help others to make their way easier through the Japanese language, as a multi-tool app available in both TUI version (Terminal User Interface App) and GUI version (Graphic User Interface App).

> [!NOTE]
> Take in consideration that this project is still under development and haven't still been released. Don't try to download this program from any other sources other than this Github.

 
 # TUI Version (Console App Application)

 ### This version is based by the Windows Terminal Application and it's meant to be as light-weighted as possible. Use this version if are working under low-end specs.

> [!CAUTION]
> This version has been temporarily paused since I will be working on the GUI version, once the GUI version of the program catches up with the console one, I will be actively working for both.

# GUI Version (Graphical User Interface)

### This version will be developed under Unity and it is meant to me more intensive than its TUI counterpart. To download this version, please refer to this [Github Link](https://github.com/GuitarHero2/Project-KOTOBADAN-GUI)
